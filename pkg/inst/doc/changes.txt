Changes from 0.4-1 to 0.5-0
=======================

1.  Bumped R version dependency to R >= 3.0.0 because 
    we now rely on 'gridSVG' doing a grid.force() so we
    no longer have to supply special primToDev() methods
    for drawing graph edges.

    Also bumped 'gridSVG' dependency to >= 1.1 for good
    measure.


Changes from 0.4-0 to 0.4-1
=======================

1.  Added 'grobs' and 'viewports' arguments to gridTree().

1.  Moved grid.DLapply() to 'grid'.

4.  Fixed bug so that popViewport()s in display list are also ignored
    when drawing graph (just like upViewport()s and downViewport()s).



Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
=======================

1.  Renamed addTooltips() to gridTreeTips().

2.  Added grobBrowser() function.

3.  Made edgeGrob drawing a little more robust
    (defaults for 'lwd' and 'lty')

4.  Improved gridTreeTips() tooltips 
    (so that get tooltip whene mouseover ANYWHERE on node).
